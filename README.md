# Reconciliation API

Elixir app for syncing and reconciling transactions between an external source and an internal database. Includes a CLI audit tool for reporting missing transactions. See [CHALLENGE.md](./CHALLENGE.md) for the problem description and more context.

## Overview

- **Syncs transactions** from a mock external API into a Postgres database.
- **Supports incremental and full syncs** with configurable concurrency and page size.
- **Reconciliation CLI** lets you audit and compare external vs internal transactions.
- **Containerized** with Docker and Docker Compose for easy setup.
- **Makefile** provides shortcuts for common development and ops tasks.

## Requirements

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
- (Optional for local dev) Elixir ~> 1.18

## How to Run

1. **Build the Docker images**
   ```sh
   make build
   ```

2. **Start the app and database**
   ```sh
   make run
   ```

   **Note:** Database setup and migrations are run automatically when the app container starts (see `entrypoint.sh`). No need to run `make setup`.

3. **Run the reconciliation audit CLI**
   ```sh
   make reconciliation_audit
   ```

4. **View logs**
   ```sh
   make logs
   ```

5. **Open Adminer (Database Browser)**
   ```sh
   make open-adminer
   ```
   This will open Adminer at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

   **Note:** Make sure your Docker containers are running (`make run`) so the Adminer service is available.

   **Adminer connection settings:**
   - System: PostgreSQL
   - Server: db
   - Username: postgres
   - Password: postgres
   - Database: reconciliation_api_db

6. **Stop everything**
   ```sh
   make down
   ```

## Notes

- All sync and mock API parameters are configurable in `config/config.exs`.
- The CLI tool will prompt for page and batch size, and report missing transactions.

## Extras

Open an interactive Elixir shell connected to the running app container using:

```sh
make iex-connect
```

Remove all containers and volumes (including the database data) with:

```sh
make clean
